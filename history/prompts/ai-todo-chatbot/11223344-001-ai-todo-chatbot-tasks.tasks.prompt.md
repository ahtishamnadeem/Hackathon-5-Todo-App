## Implementation Tasks Created Successfully

I have successfully created the implementation tasks for the AI Agent & Conversation System. Here's what was accomplished:

### Tasks Document
- **File Path**: `specs/001-ai-todo-chatbot/tasks.md`
- **Status**: Complete with 60 detailed tasks

### Task Organization
- **Phase 1**: Setup & Environment (4 tasks)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational Components (11 tasks)
- **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - Natural Language Todo Management (P1) (13 tasks)
- **Phase 4**: User Story 4 - MCP Tool Integration (P2) (7 tasks)
- **Phase 5**: User Story 2 - Persistent Conversation Context (P1) (9 tasks)
- **Phase 6**: User Story 3 - Secure Multi-User Access (P1) (7 tasks)
- **Phase 7**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (9 tasks)

### Key Features
- All tasks follow the required checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)
- User stories organized by priority with proper dependencies
- Parallel execution opportunities identified
- Independent test criteria for each user story
- Complete file paths specified for all implementation tasks

### Implementation Strategy
- MVP scope defined focusing on User Story 1 for basic functionality
- Incremental delivery approach with foundational components first
- Proper validation and security considerations throughout

The tasks are now ready for implementation. You can proceed with `/sp.implement` to start executing these tasks.
