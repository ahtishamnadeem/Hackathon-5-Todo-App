# Response

## Constitution Update: Phase III AI-Powered Todo Chatbot

Updated the project constitution to include Phase III requirements for AI-powered chatbot with agentic architecture and MCP (Machine Control Protocol) integration.

### Changes Made

1. **Added New Principles**:
   - Principle IX: Agentic Architecture & MCP Standards
   - Principle X: Stateless-by-Design Architecture
   - Principle XI: Observability & Traceability

2. **Expanded Phase III Definition**:
   - Defined AI agent using OpenAI Agents SDK
   - Specified MCP server using Official MCP SDK
   - Added agentic architecture with explicit reasoning delegation
   - Required deterministic tool execution with structured schemas

3. **Added New Sections**:
   - Phase III AI System Standards
   - MCP Server Standards
   - Conversation & Memory Standards
   - Security Extensions for AI/MCP Integration
   - MCP Tool Conventions and Response Formats

4. **Updated Version**: 2.0.0 → 3.0.0 (MAJOR change due to new architectural requirements)

### Key Requirements Added

- AI agents must operate through well-defined MCP tools only
- All backend services and MCP tools must remain stateless
- Conversation state must persist in database
- All agent actions must be traceable and auditable
- User isolation must extend to AI layer
- JWT authentication required for all chat endpoints

### Implementation Status

- ✅ Constitution updated with Phase III requirements
- ✅ All new principles and standards documented
- ✅ Security requirements extended for AI layer
- ✅ MCP conventions defined
- ✅ Version bumped to 3.0.0 (major update)

The constitution now properly defines the requirements for implementing an AI-powered todo chatbot with agentic architecture while maintaining all previous security and correctness guarantees.
